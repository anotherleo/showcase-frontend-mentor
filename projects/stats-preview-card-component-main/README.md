## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

The first thing I did was to use [Color Picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/en) to get started with the pallete and adding the background color in CSS... Actually, the zero thing I did was to crop attribution style and past into the CSS file and write my name in the HTML. I don't know, I think was sort of "okay, now my name is on this thing so it means that's my problem now, then I'm gonna solve it".  
Once the body was colored, I choose all the elements for the HTML and styled them in CSS, guessing the sizes using rem.
I've searched the font in Google Fonts using 'Get insights QUERIES', and Noto Sans was my guess. 
Next, added the image and started to play around using @media. 
By the end, added the overlay, but with help of a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXQ9l0ScDEA). 
I've forgot to round the corners, and even that I was able to solve it, I'm not satisfied with the code.
When I finally ended the project, I've found the "style-guide.md" with right fonts and styles LMAO'... Anyway, decided to submit the version as I've first made.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Was the first time that I've tried to built something that wasn't only in my imagination or just free to tweak and twist around.

### Continued development
